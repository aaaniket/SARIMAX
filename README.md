##  Advanced SARIMAX Forecasting Model

---

**Project Overview**: This repository hosts an advanced SARIMAX (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables) forecasting model, designed to predict future values by integrating both seasonal adjustments and external influences. This model is highly applicable across various sectors where forecasting accuracy is critical for operational efficiency and strategic planning.

### Workflow of the SARIMAX Model

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather historical time series data and identify relevant exogenous variables.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean the data and transform it to ensure consistency and accuracy.
   
3. **Parameter Estimation**:
   - Use statistical methods like ACF and PACF plots to determine the optimal parameters for the SARIMA and seasonal components.
   
4. **Model Integration**:
   - Integrate the chosen parameters and exogenous factors into the SARIMAX model.
   
5. **Model Fitting**:
   - Fit the model to the historical data to learn the data patterns.
   
6. **Forecasting**:
   - Predict future values using the fitted model.
   
7. **Evaluation**:
   - Assess the modelâ€™s performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE).
   
8. **Deployment**:
   - Implement the model in a real-time system for ongoing forecasting.
